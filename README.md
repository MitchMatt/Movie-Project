Microsoft Movie Studio Analysis

Overview
Problem Statement:
Microsoft aims to venture into the film industry by establishing a new movie studio. The objective is to create, produce, and distribute original video content. However, with limited experience in the movie industry, Microsoft needs to gain insights into the types of films that perform well at the box office. This analysis seeks to provide actionable insights to guide Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed decisions about the types of films to create.

Business Understanding
Domain: Film and Entertainment Industry

Stakeholders:

Microsoft Production Team:
Key Questions: 
How can we ensure that our movies are the meet the criteria for audiences to enjoy?
How can we optimize the movie production process to ensure a steady output of quality films while managing budgets effectively?

Microsoft Finance Department:
Key Questions: 
How can we ensure that our budget allocation aligns with revenue expectations and that we are making cost-effective decisions?
How can we plan our movie budgets to ensure a steady income stream?

Data Understanding:
This dataset comprises two main tables. The first table includes columns such as 'movie_id,' 'primary_title,' 'start_year,' 'runtime_minutes,' 'genres,' and 'movie_rating.' These columns provide information about various movies, including their titles, release years, durations, genres, and ratings.

The second table, on the other hand, contains columns like 'id,' 'release_date,' 'movie,' 'production_budget,' 'domestic_gross,' and 'worldwide_gross.' This table focuses on financial aspects, including production budgets, domestic and worldwide gross earnings, and release dates. By analyzing these datasets.

We can gain insights into the performance and characteristics of different movies, their financial success, and how factors like genre and runtime may influence their ratings and earnings.

The analysis contains the following:
1. Business Understanding
2. Importing libraries and datasets
3. Previewing the datasets
4. Data Cleaning
5. Exploratory data analysis(Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate)
6. Summary
7. Recommendations
   
Summary of Conclusions:

Enhanced Data Quality Assessment:
Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies significantly improved the reliability of the dataset, making it suitable for analysis.

Evaluated Data Completeness:
We assessed data completeness by analyzing missing values and taking appropriate actions to enhance data quality.

Ensured Data Integrity:
Data integrity issues such as negative values were identified and corrected, contributing to data reliability.

Refined Data Types:
Data types were reviewed and adjusted, including date conversion for time-based analysis and numeric conversions for mathematical computations.

Derived Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize dataset attributes, providing valuable insights.

Optimal Movie Runtime:
Analysis revealed that the average runtime for successful movies hovers around 90 minutes, indicating audience preferences.

Genre and Median Ratings:
Music-related movies achieved higher median ratings, suggesting potential opportunities in this genre.

Steady Investment Strategy:
A consistent trend in average income per movie around $96 million suggests maintaining a steady investment in movie production.

Production Budget and Revenue Correlation:
A positive correlation exists between production budgets and worldwide gross revenue, emphasizing the importance of budget allocation

Recommendations
The recommendations to Microsoft were as follows:
Based on my findings, I would recommend the following to Microsoft:
1. Optimal Movie Runtime:
Consider targeting an average runtime of around 90 minutes for your movies, as this has been the historical average. This duration tends to align with audience preferences and can optimize viewer engagement.
2. Genre Selection:
Given that music movies have a higher median rating, consider producing or investing in music-related films as they have a better chance of receiving favorable ratings from viewers. However, also explore other genres that align with your studio's vision and capabilities
3. Budget and Revenue:
Recognize the positive correlation between production budget and worldwide gross revenue. While investing more in a movie may lead to higher returns, be cautious and conduct thorough financial analysis and risk assessment for high-budget productions. Consider a balanced portfolio of both high and low-budget films to mitigate risk
4. Steady Investment:
 Given that the average income per movie has been relatively stable for most years (around $96 million), Microsoft should plan for a steady investment in movie production to maintain consistent revenue. This can involve setting an annual budget for movie production.
5. Diersify Portfolio: 
As evident, movie production took a downward trend in 2019. I would recommend considering diversifying the movie portfolio to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in movie production. Instead of relying heavily on a single year's output, aim for a more balanced and sustainable production strategy.
Next steps
The next steps recommended to Microsoft are:
1.	Film Development Strategy:
•	Microsoft should start by analyzing its existing movie development pipeline to see how well it aligns with the optimal movie runtime and genre selection recommendations. This involves evaluating current projects and considering adjustments or new projects that fit the 90-minute runtime and prioritize music-related genres.
2.	Budget Planning:
•	Conduct a detailed financial analysis for upcoming projects. This includes estimating the potential return on investment (ROI) for both high and low-budget films. Microsoft should set a budget for movie production based on this analysis, ensuring that it's in line with the company's financial goals.
3.	Risk Assessment:
•	Implement a robust risk assessment process that evaluates the potential risks associated with each movie project. High-budget productions may offer higher returns, but they also carry higher risks. Microsoft should have a risk mitigation strategy in place for these projects, which could include insurance, partnerships, or co-productions.
